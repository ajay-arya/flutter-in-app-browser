# Coding workflow prefernces

- Focus on areas of code relevent to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a featue works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly structed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
- Always maintain a readme.md file and keep it upto date. when you add any feature update readme file as well and if not exist please create it.
